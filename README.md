# Python_for_ML_Lab

The programs are used for teaching AIML laboratory. The list of experiments are:

1. Depth First Search Algorithm
2. Tic-Tac-Toe Game using DFS
3. Program to create histograms for all numerical features and analyze the distribution of each feature. Generate box plots for all numerical features and identify any outliers. The dataset used is the California Housing Dataset
4. To check if an instance of the 8 puzzle is solvable. Using the theory of inversion. Reference: https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/check-instance-8-puzzle-solvable/
5. Find-S algorithm for enjoysport.csv dataset
6. KNN Classifier for IRIS Dataset
7. LWR Regression using housing dataset
8. Naive Bayes Classifier from Scratch NB_scratch.ipynb, also check NB Exercise.pdf in Docs Folder
9. Naive Bayes Classifier using the library
10. Neural network with different activation functions like sigmoid, ReLu and Tanh
11. RBFNN with two different kernels, viz, Gaussian and Generalized multi-quadric function
